# Audio-Recording-System-using-Python-Socket-Programming
Computer Networks Mini Project (4th sem)

Using TCP protocol and python socket, clients can send audio data to the server using PyAudio and Wave libraries.
We can have multiple clients sending data to a server. Clients can record audio data first and store them into a .wav file
which is further sent to a server and the filename of the received audio file is the arrival time of that file.
